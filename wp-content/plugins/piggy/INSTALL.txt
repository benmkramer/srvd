It is assumed for the purposes of this document that if you choose to upload Piggy via FTP or SSH that you know how to do so, and are comfortable with the process of configuring permissions, etc.

= Activating the License w/ Piggy =

Activating your Piggy license is easy.

To verify your account/license credentials, first visit the Piggy administration page, found in your WordPress install at:

(Left Side Menu) -> WP E-Commerce -> Piggy

When the Piggy admin page loads, you’ll see a notice banner with a link to begin the activation process: click it.

You’ll now be taken to the account tab, and see two text inputs. Enter your account email address then License Key, and click the ‘Save Changes’ button at the bottom of the form.

When completed and successful, your Piggy installation will confirm a license for the site, and activation will be complete - enjoy Piggy!
